# Simple Calculator with Observability and Tracing

This example demonstrates how to implement **observability and tracing capabilities** using the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit. You'll learn to monitor, trace, and analyze your AI agent's behavior in real-time using the Simple Calculator workflow.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Platform Observability Integration:** Demonstrates integration with multiple observability platforms including Phoenix (local), Langfuse, LangSmith, Weave, Patronus, and RagaAI Catalyst for comprehensive monitoring options.
- **Distributed Tracing Implementation:** Shows how to track agent execution flow across components with detailed trace visualization including agent reasoning, tool calls, and LLM interactions.
- **Performance Monitoring:** Demonstrates capturing latency metrics, token usage, resource consumption, and error tracking for production-ready AI system monitoring.
- **Development and Production Patterns:** Provides examples for both local development tracing (Phoenix) and production monitoring setups with various enterprise observability platforms.
- **Comprehensive Telemetry Collection:** Shows automatic capture of agent thought processes, function invocations, model calls, error events, and custom metadata for complete workflow visibility.

## What You'll Learn

- **Distributed tracing**: Track agent execution flow across components
- **Performance monitoring**: Observe latency, token usage, and system metrics
- **Multi-platform integration**: Connect with popular observability tools
- **Real-time analysis**: Monitor agent behavior during execution
- **Production readiness**: Set up monitoring for deployed AI systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this example, you need:

1. **Agent toolkit**: Ensure you have the Agent toolkit installed. If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent Toolkit.
2. **Base workflow**: This example builds upon the Getting Started [Simple Calculator](../../getting_started/simple_calculator/) example. Make sure you are familiar with the example before proceeding.
3. **Observability platform**: Access to at least one of the supported platforms (Phoenix, Langfuse, LangSmith, Weave, or Patronus)

## Installation

Install this observability example:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability
```

## Getting Started

### Phoenix Tracing

Phoenix provides local tracing capabilities perfect for development and testing.

1. Install Phoenix:

    ```bash
    uv pip install arize-phoenix
    ```

2. Start Phoenix in a separate terminal:

    ```bash
    phoenix serve
    ```

3. Run the workflow with tracing enabled:

    ```bash
    nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-phoenix.yml --input "What is 2 * 4?"
    ```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:6006` to explore traces in the Phoenix UI.

### File-Based Tracing

For simple local development and debugging, you can export traces directly to a local file without requiring any external services.

1. Run the workflow with file-based tracing:

    ```bash
    nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-otel-file.yml --input "What is 2 * 4?"
    ```

2. View the traces in the generated file:

    ```bash
    cat nat_simple_calculator_traces.jsonl
    ```

    The traces are stored in JSON Lines format, with each line representing a complete trace. This is useful for:
    - Quick debugging during development
    - Offline analysis of workflow execution
    - Integration with custom analysis tools
    - Archiving traces for later review

### Langfuse Integration

[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) provides production-ready monitoring and analytics.

1. Get your Langfuse credentials:

    Under your project settings, you can create your API key. Doing this will give you three credentials:
    - Secret Key
    - Public Key
    - Host

    Take note of these credentials as you will need them to run the workflow.

2. Set your Langfuse credentials:

    ```bash
    export LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your_key>
    export LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret>
    export LANGFUSE_HOST=<your_host>
    ```

3. Run the workflow:

    ```bash
    nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-langfuse.yml --input "Calculate 15 + 23"
    ```

### LangSmith Integration

[LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) offers comprehensive monitoring within the LangChain/LangGraph ecosystem.

0. Get your LangSmith API key and project name:

    **API Key**:

    Once logged in, you can navigate to the settings page, then click on "API Keys".

    You can create a new API key by clicking on the "Create API Key" button. Be sure to choose the "Personal Access Token" option. Choose a workspace name and a description. Then click on the "Create" button.

    Take note of the API key as you will need it to run the workflow.

1. Set your LangSmith credentials:

    ```bash
    export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
    ```

2. Run the workflow:

    ```bash
    nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-langsmith.yml --input "Is 100 > 50?"
    ```

    This workflow is set to use the `default` LangSmith project. If you want to use a different project, you can either edit the config file or add the following flag to the above command: `--override general.telemetry.tracing.langsmith.project <your_project_name>`

    > [!NOTE]
    > This workflow happens to use LangChain, since that library has built-in support for LangSmith, if you run the above workflow with the `LANGSMITH_TRACING=true` environment variable set, will result in duplicate traces being sent to LangSmith.

### Weave Integration

[Weave](https://wandb.ai/site/weave/) provides detailed workflow tracking and visualization.

0. Get your Weights & Biases API key:

    Login to [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/weave/) and navigate to the settings page.

    Under the "Account" section, you can find your API key. Click on the "Show" button to reveal the API key. Take note of this API key as you will need it to run the workflow.

1. Set your Weights & Biases API key:

    ```bash
    export WANDB_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
    ```

2. Run the workflow:

    ```bash
    nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-weave.yml --input "What's the sum of 7 and 8?"
    ```

For detailed Weave setup instructions, see the [Fine-grained Tracing with Weave](../../../docs/source/workflows/observe/observe-workflow-with-weave.md) guide.

### AI Safety Monitoring with Patronus

[Patronus](https://patronus.ai/) enables AI safety monitoring and compliance tracking.

1. Get your Catalyst credentials and create a project:

    1. Login to [RagaAI Catalyst](https://catalyst.raga.ai/) and navigate to the settings page.

    2. Click on the "Authenticate" tab, then click on "Generate New Key". Take note of the Access Key and Secret Key as you will need them to run the workflow.
    3. Click on "Projects" in the left sidebar, then click on the "Create Project" button. Name your project `simple-calculator` and click "Create". Alternately another project name can be used, just ensure to update the project name in `examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-catalyst.yml` to match.


2. Set your Catalyst API key:

    ```bash
    export CATALYST_ACCESS_KEY=<your_access_key>
    export CATALYST_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
    ```

    Optionally set a custom endpoint (default is `https://catalyst.raga.ai/api`):

    ```bash
    export CATALYST_ENDPOINT=<your_endpoint>
    ```

3. Set the NAT_SPAN_PREFIX environment variable to `aiq` for RagaAI Catalyst compatibility:

    ```bash
    export NAT_SPAN_PREFIX=aiq
    ```

4. Run the workflow:

    ```bash
    nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-catalyst.yml --input "Divide 144 by 12"
    ```

5. Return to the RagaAI Catalyst dashboard to view your traces.
    Click on "Projects" in the left sidebar, then select your `simple-calculator` project (or the name you used). You should see `simple-calculator-dataset` listed in the datasets. Click on the dataset to bring up the traces.
