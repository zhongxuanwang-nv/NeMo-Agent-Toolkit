# NeMo Agent Toolkit Profiler Agent

The profiler agent is a tool that allows you to analyze the performance of NeMo Agent toolkit workflows. It uses the Phoenix server to store and retrieve traces of workflow runs.

## Key Features

- **Workflow Performance Analysis:** Demonstrates a specialized agent that analyzes NeMo Agent toolkit workflow performance using Phoenix server traces for comprehensive performance monitoring.
- **Token Usage Tracking:** Shows how to retrieve and analyze token consumption patterns across multiple workflow runs, providing insights into LLM resource utilization.
- **Trace Visualization:** Generates flowcharts and visual representations of workflow execution patterns from stored Phoenix traces using natural language queries.
- **Phoenix Server Integration:** Demonstrates integration with Phoenix observability platform for storing, retrieving, and analyzing workflow telemetry data.
- **Natural Language Interface:** Provides a conversational interface for querying performance metrics, making complex trace analysis accessible through simple questions.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/advanced_agents/profiler_agent
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

## Run the Workflow

1. Start the Phoenix server if not already running. If you are using a remote Phoenix server, you can skip this step and modify the configs/config.yml file to point to the URL.
   ```bash
   docker run -p 6006:6006 -p 4317:4317 -i -t arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
   ```

2. Ensure that there are traces in the Phoenix server. You can use the simple calculator example to generate traces.
   > [!NOTE]
   > This requires installing both the optional `telemetry` dependencies along with the simple calculator. You can do this by running the following commands:
   > ```bash
   > uv pip install -e examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability
   > ```

   Then, run the simple calculator example to generate traces:
   ```bash
   nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-phoenix.yml --input "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
   nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-phoenix.yml --input "Is the product of 33 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
   nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-phoenix.yml --input "Is the sum of 44 and 55 greater than the current hour of the day?"
   nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-phoenix.yml --input "Is the difference between 7 and 5 less than the current hour of the day?"
   ```

3. Run the profiler agent:
   ```
   nat serve --config_file=examples/advanced_agents/profiler_agent/configs/config.yml
   ```

4. Launch the NeMo Agent Toolkit User Interface by using the instructions in the [Launching the UI](../../../docs/source/quick-start/launching-ui.md) guide.

5. Query the agent with natural language via the UI:
   ```
   Show me the token usage of last run
   ```

   ![Sample Response](../../../docs/source/_static/profiler-agent.png "Sample Response UI Image")

   More examples:
   ```
   Show me flowchart of last 3 runs
   ```

   ```
   Analyze the last 2 runs
   ```

## Features

- Query Phoenix traces with natural language
- Analyze LLM application performance metrics
- Generate trace visualizations
- Extract user queries across trace spans
