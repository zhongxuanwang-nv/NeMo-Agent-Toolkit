- **Example Support Infrastructure:** Simplifies setup of supporting services required by various examples in the repository.
- **Milvus:** Includes `docker-compose.milvus.yml` for running a Milvus server for RAG examples.
- **MinIO:** Includes `docker-compose.minio.yml` for running a MinIO server for object store examples.
- **MySQL:** Includes `docker-compose.mysql.yml` for running a MySQL server for object store examples.
- **Phoenix Observability:** Includes `docker-compose.phoenix.yml` for running Phoenix observability server to monitor and debug workflows.
- **Redis Service:** Includes `docker-compose.redis.yml` for running Redis memory backend with Redis Insight for memory-based examples.


## Available Services

- **`milvus`**: `docker-compose.milvus.yml`
- **`minio`**: `docker-compose.minio.yml`
- **`mysql`**: `docker-compose.mysql.yml`
- **`phoenix`**: `docker-compose.phoenix.yml`
- **`redis`**: `docker-compose.redis.yml`

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Docker is installed and the Docker service is running before proceeding.

- Install Docker: Follow the official installation guide for your platform: [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- Start Docker Service:
  - Linux: Run`sudo systemctl start docker` (ensure your user has permission to run Docker).
  - Mac & Windows: Docker Desktop should be running in the background.
- Verify Docker Installation: Run the following command to verify that Docker is installed and running correctly:
```bash
docker info
```

### Running Services

To start Milvus (for RAG examples):
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.milvus.yml up -d
```

To start MinIO (for object store examples):
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.minio.yml up -d
```

To start MySQL (for object store examples):
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.mysql.yml up -d
```

To start Phoenix (for observability examples):
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.phoenix.yml up -d
```

To start Redis (required for memory and object store examples):
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.redis.yml up -d
```

### Stopping Services

To stop the Milvus service:
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.milvus.yml down
```

To stop the MinIO service:
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.minio.yml down
```

To stop the MySQL service:
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.mysql.yml down
```

To stop the Phoenix service:
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.phoenix.yml down
```

To stop the Redis service:
```bash
docker compose -f examples/deploy/docker-compose.redis.yml down
```
