## Key Features

- **Reduce Configuration Duplication**: Define common settings once in a base configuration and reuse across multiple variants
- **Selective Overrides**: Override specific values at any nesting level while inheriting all other settings
- **Multi-Level Inheritance**: Chain multiple configuration files together for progressive customization
- **Flexible File Organization**: Reference base configurations using relative or absolute paths

## How It Works

### Base Configuration

The base config (`base-config.yml`) contains all common settings:

```yaml
general:
  telemetry:
    logging:
      console:
        level: INFO

llms:
  nim_llm:
    model_name: meta/llama-3.1-70b-instruct
    temperature: 0.0
    max_tokens: 1024

workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  tool_names: [calculator, current_datetime]
  llm_name: nim_llm
  verbose: true
```

### Variant Configuration

Each variant specifies the base and overrides only what's different:

```yaml
# config-high-temp.yml
base: base-config.yml

llms:
  nim_llm:
    temperature: 0.9  # Override just this one value
```

The result is a fully merged configuration with:
- `temperature: 0.9` (overridden)
- All other settings inherited from base

### Chained Inheritance

You can create multi-level inheritance chains where variant configurations inherit from other variants, allowing progressive customization. For example:

```yaml
# base-config.yml
llms:
  nim_llm:
    temperature: 0.0
general:
  telemetry:
    logging:
      console:
        level: INFO
```

```yaml
# config-high-temp.yml
base: base-config.yml
llms:
  nim_llm:
    temperature: 0.9
```

```yaml
# config-high-temp-debug.yml
base: config-high-temp.yml  # Inherits from variant, not base
general:
  telemetry:
    logging:
      console:
        level: DEBUG
```

Result for `config-high-temp-debug.yml`:
- `temperature: 0.9` (from config-high-temp.yml)
- `console.level: DEBUG` (from config-high-temp-debug.yml)
- All other settings inherited from base-config.yml

Configuration files can also reference base configurations in other directories using either relative or absolute paths.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install the NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/config_inheritance
```

### Set Up API Keys

If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

### Run Workflows with Variant Configurations

This example shows a simple calculator workflow with several configuration variants:

- **`base-config.yml`** - Base configuration with common settings
- **`config-high-temp.yml`** - Variant with higher temperature for creative responses
- **`config-debug.yml`** - Variant with verbose logging for debugging
- **`config-different-model.yml`** - Variant using a different LLM model
- **`config-with-tracing.yml`** - Variant with Weave tracing enabled
- **`config-high-temp-debug.yml`** - Chained inheritance example (base → high-temp → high-temp-debug)

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the workflow with different configuration variants:

```bash
# Test basic inheritance
nat run --config_file examples/config_inheritance/configs/config-high-temp.yml --input "What is 25 * 4?"

# Test chained inheritance
nat run --config_file examples/config_inheritance/configs/config-high-temp-debug.yml --input "What is 25 * 4?"

# Compare with debug variant
nat run --config_file examples/config_inheritance/configs/config-debug.yml --input "What is 25 * 4?"
```

---

## Use Cases

Configuration inheritance is particularly useful for:

- **Environment-specific configurations**: Create separate variants for development, staging, and production environments
- **Evaluation configurations**: Define different evaluation scenarios while maintaining consistent base workflow settings
- **Model experiments**: Test different hyperparameters while keeping the workflow structure unchanged
- **LLM provider variations**: Switch between different LLM backends without duplicating configuration
- **Feature toggles**: Enable or disable features through small configuration overrides
- **Team member configurations**: Allow team members to overlay personal preferences on shared defaults
- **Progressive customization**: Start with a base configuration and incrementally add features
