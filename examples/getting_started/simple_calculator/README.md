# A Simple LLM Calculator

This example demonstrates an end-to-end (E2E) agentic workflow using the NeMo Agent toolkit library, fully configured through a YAML file. It showcases the NeMo Agent toolkit plugin system and `Builder` to seamlessly integrate pre-built and custom tools into workflows.

## Key Features

- **Custom Calculator Tools:** Demonstrates six tools - `calculator.add`, `calculator.subtract`, `calculator.multiply`, `calculator.divide`, `calculator.compare`, and `current_datetime` for mathematical operations and time-based comparisons.
- **ReAct Agent Integration:** Uses a `react_agent` that performs reasoning between tool calls to solve complex mathematical queries requiring multiple steps.
- **Multi-step Problem Solving:** Shows how an agent can break down complex questions like "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour?" into sequential tool calls.
- **Custom Function Registration:** Demonstrates the NeMo Agent toolkit plugin system for registering custom mathematical functions with proper validation and error handling.
- **YAML-based Configuration:** Fully configurable workflow that showcases how to orchestrate multiple tools through simple configuration.

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/getting_started/simple_calculator
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>  # OPTIONAL
```

### Run the Workflow

Return to your original terminal, and run the following command from the root of the NeMo Agent toolkit repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_calculator/configs/config.yml --input "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"
```

**Expected Workflow Output**
Note that the output is subject to the time of day when the workflow was run. For this example output, it was run in the afternoon.
```
No, the product of 2 * 4 (which is 8) is less than the current hour of the day (which is 15).
```


## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the NeMo Agent toolkit virtual environment.

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg NAT_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t simple_calculator -f examples/getting_started/simple_calculator/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -p 6006:6006 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY -e OPENAI_API_KEY simple_calculator
```

Note, a phoenix telemetry service will be exposed at port 6006.

### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"input_message": "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?"}'
```

### Expected API Output
The API response should be similar to the following:

```bash
{
  "input": "Is the product of 2 * 4 greater than the current hour of the day?",
  "value": "No, the product of 2 * 4 (which is 8) is less than the current hour of the day (which is 16)."
}
```
