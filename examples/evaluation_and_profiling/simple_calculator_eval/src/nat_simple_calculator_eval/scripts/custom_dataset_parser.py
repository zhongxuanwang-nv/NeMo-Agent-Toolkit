    This is a sample custom dataset parser that:
    1. Loads a nested JSON file
    2. Extracts the questions array from the nested structure
    3. Applies optional filtering by difficulty (hard, medium, easy)
    4. Applies an optional maximum number of questions to return
    5. Creates an EvalInput object with the extracted questions and returns it

    Expects JSON format:
