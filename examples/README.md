# NeMo Agent Toolkit Examples

Each NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit example demonstrates a particular feature or use case of the NeMo Agent toolkit library. Most of these contain a custom [workflow](../docs/source/tutorials/index.md) along with a set of custom tools ([functions](../docs/source/workflows/functions/index.md) in NeMo Agent toolkit). These examples can be used as a starting off point for creating your own custom workflows and tools. Each example contains a `README.md` file that explains the use case along with instructions on how to run the example.

## Examples Repository
In addition the examples in this repository, there are examples in the [NeMo-Agent-Toolkit-Examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit-Examples) repository.

The difference between the examples in this repository and the NeMo-Agent-Toolkit-Examples repository is that the examples in this repository are maintained, tested, and updated with each release of the NeMo Agent toolkit. These examples have high quality standards and demonstrate a capability of the NeMo Agent toolkit.

The examples in the NeMo-Agent-Toolkit-Examples repository are community contributed and are tied to a specific version of the NeMo Agent toolkit, and do not need to demonstrate a specific capability of the library.
