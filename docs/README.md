# Building Documentation

## Prerequisites
If you don't already have a uv environment setup, refer to the [Get Started](./source/quick-start/installing.md) guide.

## Install Documentation Dependencies
```bash
uv sync --all-groups --all-extras
```

## Build Documentation
<!-- path-check-skip-begin -->
```bash
make -C docs

# preview with local server (open http://localhost:8000 in your browser)
python -m http.server --directory docs/build/html 8000

```
<!-- path-check-skip-next-line -->
Outputs to `docs/build/docs/html`

**Note**: When viewing documentation locally, the version switcher in the navigation bar will redirect to the production documentation site (`https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/`) when selecting a different version. This is expected behavior, as the version switcher uses absolute URLs to ensure proper page path preservation in production.

## Contributing
Refer to the [Contributing to NeMo Agent toolkit](./source/resources/contributing.md) guide.

When you create your pull request, CI will perform a documentation build as part of the pipeline. If successful, the documentation will be available for download as an artifact.
