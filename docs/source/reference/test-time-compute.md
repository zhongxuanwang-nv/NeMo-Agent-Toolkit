# Test Time Compute With NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit
Test time compute reallocates compute after a model has been trained, trading extra inference cycles for much better reasoning, factuality, and robustness, often without any additional training data. The new **`nat.experimental.test_time_compute`** package codifies this idea as four strategy types (Search ▶ Editing ▶ Scoring ▶ Selection) that operate on a lightweight `TTCItem` record.  Developers can compose these strategies manually or use several **pre‑built TTC functions** that wire everything up automatically. To add your own strategy, you can simply follow these steps:
1. Write a config subclass.
2. Implement a `StrategyBase` child.
3. Register it with the `@register_ttc_strategy` decorator.
The remainder of this document explains each step in detail.

## Core Design

### Strategy pipeline

| Stage         | Purpose                                                      | Examples                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Search**    | Generate many alternative plans, prompts, or tool invocations | `single_shot_multi_plan`, `multi_llm_plan`, `multi_query_retrieval_search`, `multi_llm_generation`                                            |
| **Editing**   | Refine or transform the candidates                           | `iterative_plan_refinement`, `llm_as_a_judge_editor`, `motivation_aware_summarization`                                                        |
| **Scoring**   | Assign a numeric quality score                               | `llm_based_plan_scorer`, `llm_based_agent_scorer`, `motivation_aware_scorer`                                                                  |
| **Selection** | Down‑select or merge                                         | `best_of_n_selector`, `threshold_selector`, `llm_based_plan_selector`, `llm_based_output_merging_selector`, `llm_based_agent_output_selector`, `llm_judge_selection` |

A pipeline type tells a strategy where it is used.

```text
PipelineTypeEnum = { PLANNING, TOOL_USE, AGENT_EXECUTION, CUSTOM }
StageTypeEnum    = { SEARCH, EDITING, SCORING, SELECTION }
```

Each strategy exposes the following methods to the `Builder` to allow the `Builder` to resolve dependencies and ensure type safety:

```python
supported_pipeline_types() -> list[PipelineTypeEnum]
stage_type()                -> StageTypeEnum
```

The `Builder` will ensure that when an `TTC Strategy` is requested, that the stage and pipeline types match the implementation's supported types.

### `StrategyBase`

Every concrete strategy extends `StrategyBase`.

```python
class MyStrategy(StrategyBase):
    async def build_components(self, builder): ...
    async def ainvoke(
            self,
            items: list[TTCItem],
            original_prompt: str | None = None,
            agent_context:  str | None = None,
    ) -> list[TTCItem]:
        ...
```

*Implementation hint*: Use the `Builder` helpers (`get_llm`, `get_function`, …) during `build_components` to resolve references once and cache them.

### `TTCItem`

A **single, interoperable record** passed between stages.

| Field      | Meaning                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `input`    | Raw user task / tool `args`           |
| `output`   | Generated answer / tool result      |
| `plan`     | Execution plan (planning pipelines) |
| `feedback` | Review comments from editing stages |
| `score`    | Numeric quality metric              |
| `metadata` | Arbitrary auxiliary data            |
| `name`     | Tool name or other identifier       |

Because it is a `pydantic.BaseModel`, you get `.model_dump()` and validation for free.

## Built‑in Strategies

Below is a non‑exhaustive catalog you can use immediately; refer to the inline doc‑strings for full parameter lists.

| Category  | `Config` class                                                    | One‑liner                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Search    | `SingleShotMultiPlanConfig`                                     | Few‑shot prompt that emits *n* candidate plans at different temperatures. |
|           | `MultiLLMPlanConfig`                                            | Query multiple LLMs in parallel, then concatenate plans.                  |
|           | `MultiQueryRetrievalSearchConfig`                               | Reformulate a retrieval query from diverse perspectives.                  |

| Editing   | `IterativePlanRefinementConfig`                                 | Loop: *plan → critique → edit*.                                           |
|           | `LLMAsAJudgeEditorConfig`                                       | “Feedback LLM + editing LLM” cooperative refinement.                      |
|           | `MotivationAwareSummarizationConfig`                            | Grounded summary that respects user’s “motivation”.                       |
| Scoring   | `LLMBasedPlanScoringConfig`                                     | Judge execution plans on a 1‑10 scale.                                    |
|           | `LLMBasedAgentScoringConfig`                                    | Judge final agent answers.                                                |
|           | `MotivationAwareScoringConfig`                                  | Score w\.r.t. task + motivation context.                                  |
| Selection | `BestOfNSelectionConfig`                                        | Keep the highest‑scoring item.                                            |
|           | `ThresholdSelectionConfig`                                      | Filter by score ≥ τ.                                                      |
|           | `LLMBasedPlanSelectionConfig` / …AgentOutput… / …OutputMerging… | Let an LLM choose or merge.                                               |
|           | `LLMJudgeSelectionConfig`                                       | Use a Judge LLM to select the best response.                              |


## Pre‑Built TTC Functions

NeMo Agent toolkit ships higher‑level wrappers that hide all orchestration.

| Function                              | Use‑case                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`ttc_tool_wrapper_function`**       | Turn an arbitrary function into a *tool*; the wrapper asks an LLM to translate free‑text into structured arguments. |
| **`ttc_tool_orchestration_function`** | Accepts a list of tool invocations, optionally runs search/edit/score/select, then executes each tool concurrently. |
| **`execute_score_select_function`**   | Run a function *k* times, score each output, pick the best.                                                         |
| **`plan_select_execute_function`**    | End‑to‑end: plan → optionally edit/score → select plan → feed downstream agent.                                     |
| **`multi_llm_judge_function`**        | Run multi-LLM generation and judge-based selection to answer a query.                                               |

These are declared in `nat.experimental.test_time_compute.functions.*` and can be referenced in your `Config` just like any other function.

## Creating and Registering a New Strategy

Follow the steps below to create and register a new strategy.

1. Define a `config` model.

   ```python
   class MyStrategyConfig(TTCStrategyBaseConfig, name="my_strategy"):
       my_param: float = 0.5
   ```

2. Implement the strategy

   ```python
   from nat.experimental.test_time_compute.models.strategy_base import StrategyBase
   class MyStrategy(StrategyBase):
       ...
   ```

3. Register the strategy.

   ```python
   from nat.cli.register_workflow import register_ttc_strategy

   @register_ttc_strategy(config_type=MyStrategyConfig)
   async def register_my_strategy(cfg: MyStrategyConfig, builder: Builder):
       strat = MyStrategy(cfg)
       await strat.build_components(builder)
       yield strat
   ```

Your strategy is now discoverable by `TypeRegistry` and can be referenced in `Config` fields.

---

## Composing Strategies in a `Config`

TTC Strategies can be part of workflow configurations, just like other components such as `LLMs`. For example, the following configuration excerpt shows how an TTC strategy can be
configured in a `config.yml` file and used in a workflow function:

```yaml
ttc_strategies:
  selection_strategy:
    _type: llm_based_agent_output_merging
    selection_llm: nim_llm

workflow:
  _type: execute_score_select_function
  selector: selection_strategy
  augmented_fn: react_agent_executor
  num_executions: 3
```

## Extending Tools and Pipelines

* **Multiple stages**: Nothing stops you from chaining *search → edit → search* again, as long as each stage returns `List[TTCItem]`.
* **Streaming**: Strategies themselves are non‑streaming, but you can wrap a streaming LLM in an TTC pipeline by choosing an appropriate pre‑built function such as `plan_select_execute_function`, which keeps streaming support if the downstream agent streams.
* **Debugging**: Log levels are respected through the standard `logging` module; export `NAT_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` for verbose traces, including every intermediate `TTCItem`.


## Testing your strategy

Write isolated unit tests by instantiating your config and strategy directly, then call `ainvoke` with hand‑crafted `TTCItem` lists.  Refer to the companion `tests/` directory for reference tests on `ThresholdSelector` and `BestOfNSelector`.


Happy scaling!
