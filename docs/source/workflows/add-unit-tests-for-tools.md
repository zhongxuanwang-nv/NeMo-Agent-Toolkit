# Adding Unit Tests for Tools

## Overview

Use `nat.test.ToolTestRunner` to test tools in complete isolation without requiring spinning up entire workflows, agents, and external services. This allows you to validate tool functionality quickly and reliably during development. Refer `tests/nat/tools/test_tool_test_runner.py` for a full example.

The `nvidia-nat-test` package must be installed to use the `ToolTestRunner`.

If you are working with a checkout of the NeMo Agent Toolkit repository, you can install it in editable mode:
```bash
uv pip install -e '.[test]'
```

Alternatively, if working outside of the repository, install with:
```bash
uv pip install nvidia-nat-test
```

## Basic Usage

### Testing a Simple Tool

The following example demonstrates testing a basic multiplication tool:

```python
from nat.test import ToolTestRunner
from my_calculator.register import MultiplyToolConfig

async def test_multiply_tool():
    runner = ToolTestRunner()
    result = await runner.test_tool(
        config_type=MultiplyToolConfig,
        input_data="What is 2 times 4?",
        expected_output="The product of 2 * 4 is 8"
    )

    # The framework automatically validates the expected output
    # Add additional assertions if needed
    assert "8" in result
    assert "product" in result
```

### Testing Error Handling

Verify that your tools handle invalid input:

```python
async def test_tool_error_handling():
    runner = ToolTestRunner()
    result = await runner.test_tool(
        config_type=MultiplyToolConfig,
        input_data="Multiply just one number: 5"
    )

    # Tool should return error message for invalid input
    assert "Provide at least 2 numbers" in result
```

## Advanced Usage

### Testing Tools with Dependencies

For tools that depend on LLMs, memory, retrievers, or other components, use the mocked dependencies context:

```python
from nat.test import with_mocked_dependencies

async def test_tool_with_llm_dependency():
    async with with_mocked_dependencies() as (runner, mock_builder):
        # Mock the LLM response
        mock_builder.mock_llm("gpt-4", "Mocked LLM response")

        # Mock memory responses
        mock_builder.mock_memory_client("user_memory", {
            "retrieved_data": "important context"
        })

        # Mock retriever responses
        mock_builder.mock_retriever("knowledge_base", [
            {"text": "relevant document", "score": 0.9}
        ])

        # Test the tool with mocked dependencies
        result = await runner.test_tool_with_builder(
            config_type=SmartToolConfig,
            builder=mock_builder,
            config_params={"llm_name": "gpt-4"},
            input_data="complex query requiring context"
        )

        assert "mocked" in result.lower()
```

### Available Mock Methods

The `MockBuilder` provides mocking for all major components:

```python
# Mock LLM responses
mock_builder.mock_llm("model_name", "Fixed response")

# Mock embedder responses
mock_builder.mock_embedder("embedder_name", [0.1, 0.2, 0.3])

# Mock memory client responses
mock_builder.mock_memory_client("memory_name", {"key": "value"})

# Mock retriever responses
mock_builder.mock_retriever("retriever_name", [
    {"text": "doc1", "score": 0.9},
    {"text": "doc2", "score": 0.8}
])

# Mock function responses
mock_builder.mock_function("function_name", "function result")
```

## Troubleshooting
The following are common errors and their troubleshooting solutions.

### Tool Not Found Error

**Error message**:
```
ValueError: Tool MyToolConfig is not registered. Make sure it's imported and registered with @register_function.
```

**Solution**: Ensure your tool's module is imported before testing:

```python
# Import the module containing your tool registration
import my_package.register  # This registers the tool

from my_package.register import MyToolConfig
```

### Mock Not Working

If mocked dependencies are not being used, check your setup order.

**Incorrect approach**:
```python
# ❌ Wrong: Mock after testing
mock_builder.mock_llm("gpt-4", "response")
result = await runner.test_tool_with_builder(...)
```

**Correct approach**:
```python
# ✅ Correct: Mock before testing
async with with_mocked_dependencies() as (runner, mock_builder):
    mock_builder.mock_llm("gpt-4", "response")  # Mock first
    result = await runner.test_tool_with_builder(
        config_type=MyToolConfig,
        builder=mock_builder,  # Pass the builder
        input_data="test"
    )
```
