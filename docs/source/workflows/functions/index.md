# Functions

Functions (tools) are the main building blocks of NeMo Agent toolkit and define the logic of your workflow.

In NeMo Agent toolkit, functions are a core abstraction that offer type-safe, asynchronous operations with support for both single and streaming outputs. They wrap callable objects (like Python functions or coroutines) and enhance them with:

* Type validation and conversion
* Schema-based input/output validation via Pydantic models
* Unified interfaces to improve composability
* Support for both streaming and non-streaming (single) outputs

## Key Concepts

### Type Safety

Functions use Python's type annotation system to:
- Validate inputs and outputs
- Convert between different types using converters
- Generate input and output schemas that provide runtime information about the function's input and output types

### Dual Output Modes

Functions support two output modes:
* **Single Output** - For operations that produce a single result
* **Streaming Output** - For operations that produce multiple results

A function can support either or both modes.

### Input and Output Schemas

Every function has schemas to define the input and output types. Every function has:
- An input schema
- A streaming output schema (optional)
- A single output schema (optional)

These schemas are Pydantic BaseModel classes that provide runtime validation and documentation. Pydantic models are used because they provide a way to validate and coerce values at runtime while also providing a way to document the schema properties of the input and output values.

### Asynchronous Operation

All function operations are asynchronous. To invoke a function, use one of the following methods:
- {py:meth}`~nat.builder.function.Function.ainvoke` - For single output operations
- {py:meth}`~nat.builder.function.Function.astream` - For streaming output operations

Using asynchronous operations allows for better performance and scalability when processing a large number of functions in parallel. In most cases, applications that integrate LLMs are IO bound and can benefit from cooperative multitasking. Asynchronous operations also provide a natural mechanism (using `ContextVar`s) for maintaining application state between multiple function invocations simultaneously.
