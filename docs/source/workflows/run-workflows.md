# Run NVIDIA NeMo Agent Toolkit Workflows

A workflow is defined by a YAML configuration file that specifies the tools and models to use. NeMo Agent toolkit provides the following ways to run a workflow:
- Using the `nat run` command.
   - This is the simplest and most common way to run a workflow.
- Using the `nat serve` command.
   - This starts a web server that listens for incoming requests and runs the specified workflow.
- Using the `nat eval` command.
   - In addition to running the workflow, it also evaluates the accuracy of the workflow.
- Using the Python API
   - This is the most flexible way to run a workflow.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have followed the instructions in the [Install Guide](../quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install NeMo Agent toolkit.

The examples in this document utilize the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow, install it by running the following commands from the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library:
```bash
uv pip install -e examples/getting_started/simple_web_query
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```


## Using the `nat run` Command
The `nat run` command is the simplest way to run a workflow. `nat run` receives a configuration file as specified by the `--config_file` flag, along with input that can be specified either directly with the `--input` flag or by providing a file path with the `--input_file` flag.

A typical invocation of the `nat run` command follows this pattern:
```
nat run --config_file <path/to/config.yml> [--input "question?" | --input_file <path/to/input.txt>]
```

The following command runs the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow with a single input question "What is LangSmith?":
```bash
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml --input "What is LangSmith?"
```

The following command runs the same workflow with the input question provided in a file:
```bash
echo "What is LangSmith?" > .tmp/input.txt
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml --input_file .tmp/input.txt
```

## Using the `nat eval` Command
The `nat eval` command is similar to the `nat run` command. However, in addition to running the workflow, it also evaluates the accuracy of the workflow, refer to [Evaluating NeMo Agent toolkit Workflows](../workflows/evaluate.md) for more information.

## Using the `nat serve` Command
The `nat serve` command starts a web server that listens for incoming requests and runs the specified workflow. The server can be accessed with a web browser or by sending a POST request to the server's endpoint. Similar to the `nat run` command, the `nat serve` command requires a configuration file specified by the `--config_file` flag.

The following command runs the `examples/getting_started/simple_web_query` workflow on a web server listening to the default port `8000` and default endpoint of `/generate`:
```bash
nat serve --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml
```

In a separate terminal, run the following command to send a POST request to the server:
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/generate \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "input_message": "What is LangSmith?"
}'
```

Refer to `nat serve --help` for more information on how to customize the server.

## Using the Python API

The toolkit offers a programmatic way to execute workflows through its Python API, allowing you to integrate workflow execution directly into your Python code. Here's how to use it:

```python
import asyncio

from nat.utils import run_workflow

result = asyncio.run(
    run_workflow(config_file='examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml',
                 prompt='What is LangSmith?'))

print(result)
```

Refer to the Python API documentation for the {py:func}`~nat.utils.run_workflow` function for detailed information about its capabilities.
