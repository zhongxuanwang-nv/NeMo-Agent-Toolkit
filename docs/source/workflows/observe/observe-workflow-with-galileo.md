# Observing a Workflow with Galileo

This guide provides a step-by-step process to enable observability in a NeMo Agent toolkit workflow using Galileo for tracing. By the end of this guide, you will have:

- Configured telemetry in your workflow.
- Ability to view traces in the Galileo platform.

## Step 1: Sign up for Galileo

- Visit [https://app.galileo.ai/](https://app.galileo.ai/) to create your account or sign in.

## Step 2: Create a Project and Log Stream

After logging in:

- Create a new **Logging** project (or reuse an existing one).
- Inside the project create (or locate) the **Log Stream** you will write to.

## Step 3: Generate API Key

Go to **Settings → API Keys** to generate a new API key and copy it.

You will need the following values:

- `Galileo-API-Key`
- `project` (project name)
- `logstream` (log-stream name)


### Step 4: Configure Your Environment
Set the following environment variables in your terminal
```bash
export GALILEO_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

## Step 5: Install the OpenTelemetry Subpackage

```bash
uv pip install '.[opentelemetry]'
```

## Step 6: Modify Workflow Configuration

Update your workflow configuration file to include the telemetry settings.

Example configuration:

```yaml
general:
  telemetry:
    logging:
      console:
        _type: console
        level: WARN
    tracing:
      galileo:
        _type: galileo
        # Cloud endpoint – change if you are using an on-prem cluster.
        endpoint: https://app.galileo.ai/api/galileo/otel/traces
        project: simple_calculator
        logstream: default
        api_key: ${GALILEO_API_KEY}
```

## Step 7: Run Your Workflow

From the root directory of the NeMo Agent toolkit library, install dependencies and run the pre-configured `simple_calculator_observability` example.

**Example:**

```bash
# Install the workflow and plugins
uv pip install -e examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/

# Run the workflow with Galileo telemetry settings
# Note, you may have to update configuration settings based on your Galileo account
nat run --config_file examples/observability/simple_calculator_observability/configs/config-galileo.yml --input "What is 1*2?"
```

As the workflow runs, telemetry data will start showing up in Galileo.

## Step 8: View Traces Data in Galileo

- Open your browser and navigate to [https://app.galileo.ai/](https://app.galileo.ai/).
- Select your project and navigate to **View all logs**.
- Inspect function execution details, latency, total tokens, request timelines and other info within individual traces.
- New traces should appear within a few seconds.
