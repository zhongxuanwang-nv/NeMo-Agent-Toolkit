# AWS Bedrock Integration

The NeMo Agent toolkit supports integration with multiple LLM providers, including AWS Bedrock. This documentation provides a comprehensive guide on how to integrate AWS Bedrock models into your NeMo Agent toolkit workflow. To view the full list of supported LLM providers, run `nat info components -t llm_provider`.


## Configuration

### Prerequisites
Before integrating AWS Bedrock, ensure you have:
- Set up AWS credentials by configuring `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- For detailed setup instructions, refer to the [AWS Bedrock setup guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/setting-up.html)

### Example Configuration
Add the AWS Bedrock LLM configuration to your workflow config file. Make sure the `region_name` matches the region of your AWS account, and the `credentials_profile_name` matches the field in your credential file:

```yaml
llms:
  aws_bedrock_llm:
    _type: aws_bedrock
    model_name: meta.llama3-3-70b-instruct-v1:0
    temperature: 0.0
    max_tokens: 1024
    top_p: 1.0
    context_size: 16384
    region_name: us-east-2
    credentials_profile_name: default
```

### Configurable Options
* `model_name`: The name of the AWS Bedrock model to use (required)
* `temperature`: Controls randomness in the output (0.0 to 1.0, default: 0.0)
* `max_tokens`: Maximum number of tokens to generate (must be > 0, default: 1024)
* `top_p`: The top-p value to use for the model. This field is ignored for LlamaIndex. (0.0 to 1.0, default: 1.0)
* `context_size`: The maximum number of tokens available for input. This is only required for LlamaIndex. This field is ignored for LangChain/LangGraph. (must be > 0, default: 1024)
* `region_name`: AWS region where your Bedrock service is hosted (default: "None")
* `base_url`: Custom Bedrock endpoint URL (default: None, needed if you don't want to use the default us-east-1 endpoint)
* `credentials_profile_name`: AWS credentials profile name from ~/.aws/credentials or ~/.aws/config files (default: None)
* `max_retries`: The maximum number of retries for the request

## Usage in Workflow
Reference the AWS Bedrock LLM in your workflow configuration:

```yaml
workflow:
  _type: react_agent
  llm_name: aws_bedrock_llm
  # ... other workflow configurations
```
