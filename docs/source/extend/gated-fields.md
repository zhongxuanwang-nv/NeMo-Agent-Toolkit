# Gated Fields

Use {py:class}`~nat.data_models.gated_field_mixin.GatedFieldMixin` to gate configuration fields based on whether an analyzed field supports them. This enables provider-agnostic, model-aware validation with sensible defaults and clear errors.

## How It Works

- **Detection keys**: The mixin scans `keys` specified on the instance to identify values used to determine if the field is supported.
- **Selection modes**: Provide exactly one of the following when subclassing:
  - `unsupported`: A sequence of compiled regex patterns that mark the detector field where the mixin's field is not supported.
  - `supported`: A sequence of compiled regex patterns that mark the detector field where the mixin's field is supported.
- **Behavior**:
  - Supported and value not provided → sets `default_if_supported`.
  - Supported and value provided → keeps the provided value (and performs all other validations if defined).
  - Unsupported and value provided → raises a validation error.
  - Unsupported and value not provided → leaves the field as `None`.
  - No detection keys present → applies `default_if_supported`.

## Implementing a Gated Field

```python
import re
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from nat.data_models.gated_field_mixin import GatedFieldMixin

class FrequencyPenaltyMixin(
    BaseModel,
    GatedFieldMixin,
    field_name="frequency_penalty",
    default_if_supported=0.0,
    keys=("model_name", "model", "azure_deployment"),
    supported=(re.compile(r"^gpt-4.*$", re.IGNORECASE),),
):
    frequency_penalty: float | None = Field(default=None, ge=0.0, le=2.0)
```

### Overriding Detection Keys

```python
class AzureOnlyMixin(
    BaseModel,
    GatedFieldMixin,
    field_name="some_param",
    default_if_supported=1,
    keys=("azure_deployment",),
    unsupported=(re.compile(r"gpt-?5", re.IGNORECASE),),
):
    some_param: int | None = Field(default=None)
    azure_deployment: str
```

## Built-in Gated Mixins

- {py:class}`~nat.data_models.thinking_mixin.ThinkingMixin`
  - Field: `thinking: bool | None`
  - Default when supported: `None` (use model default)
  - Only currently supported on Nemotron models

## Best Practices

- Use `supported` for allowlist and `unsupported` for denylist; do not set both.
- Keep regex patterns specific (anchor with `^` and `$` when appropriate).
- If your config uses a non-standard model identifier field, set `keys` accordingly.
